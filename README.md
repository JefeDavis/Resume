# Resume - Jeff Davis - resume.jefedavis.dev

This respoistory and it's companion [Resume-Operator](https://github.com/JefeDavis/Resume-Operator) serves two purposes:

* Backup of my resume for rapid deployment and development
* Showcasing some skills while I'm at it:
  - Golang
	- Docker
	- Kubernetes
	- Kubernetes Operators
	- CI/CD
	- GitHub Actions
	- MakeFile
	- Hugo Web Framework
	- HTML5, SCSS
	- Writing Great Documentation

# Why
I hate updating resumes, It's not so much writing the content that I dislike. Instead, it's messing with Word and other tools to adjust margins, dealing with columns, page breaks and just formatting in general. So, why not use a data structure language like `YAML` and let programming deal with all of the formating. Plus, the portability and rapid deployments are a big upshot as well.

Now I can store all my expierence, certifications, skills, and projects in kubernetes manifests and let the code handle the rest. I work with Kubernetes and Kuberentes Operators quite a bit, why not practice what I preach? 

## OK, but is a Kubernetes Operator really necessary?
Absolutely not, but it was a fun exercise and a neat talking point. Additionally with the other tools I've built and worked on  ([yot](github.com/vmware-tanzu-labs/yaml-overlay-tool) and [operator-builder](github.com/vmware-tanzu-labs/operator-builder)) I was able to create a fully functional operator in about 30 minutes.
